Design Document - 
	
The program consists of a single main function which computes both indexing and querying.
The program reads all the files with .txt extension in the dataset.And the GUI will take a user query in the textbox and a search button is provided which onclick	then takes the user query(or search query) and display top 10 documents which are relevant to the user query based on some scoring scheme
	It prints the following info:
		1.Id of the document
		2.Location of the file

Data structures used:

	List - List is used for storing the postings of the term
	Dictionary - Dictionary is used for storing all the terms along with its postings 

Libraries used - 

	1.python nltk for the following tasks-
		1.1 Tokenization
		1.2 Case folding
		1.3 lemmetisation

	2.Porter's Stemmer algorithm

Model used for Scoring the documents:

Vector space model:
	This ranking model is based on how close a document is to the query and scored based on differnt weightages for query and docuement.

	Many search engines allow  differnt weighting schemes for queries Vs. documents but the very standard scheme is:ddd.qqq - lnc:ltc

The variant forms used for different weightings are :

	1.For tf - 1+log(tf) where tf is the number of times the term appeared in the document

	2.For idf - log(N/df) where N is the total number of documents in the corpus and the df is the document frequency of the particular term.(i.e the number of documents a particular term appeared)
